###Analysing UC President tweets

Problewm Statement and approach is explained in TwitterAnlaysis_PrezData.docx file

What hour of the day does @PrezOno’s tweet the most on average, using every day we have twitter data? Include a plot of the expected number of tweets for each hour of the day, for those he did tweet. For example if Ono tweeted once every day at 12:30PM, his expected number of tweets between 12 and 1 would be 1. If he alternates between 2 and 3 tweets per day, his average would be 2.5.


What day of the week does @PrezOno tweet the most on average? Use the same example as in #1 but for days of the week.
